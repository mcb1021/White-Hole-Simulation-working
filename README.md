# White Hole Simulation

This simulation models a quantum bounce transition from black hole collapse into white hole expansion.  
It uses Python's `solve_ivp` for differential equations with parameters inspired by loop quantum gravity.  
See `white_hole_simulation.py` for full code and tweakable parameters.
